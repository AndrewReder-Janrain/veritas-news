        EMAIL VERIFICATION SCREENS:
        The following screens are part of the email verification user workflow.
        For a complete out-of-the-box email verification experience, these
        screens must be included on page where you are implementing email
        verification.
    ============================================================================
    -->

    <!-- verifyEmail:
        This is the landing screen after a user clicks on the link in the
        verification email sent to the user when they've registered with a
        non-verified email address.

        HOW IT WORKS: The code that is generated by Capture and included in the
        link sent in the verification email is sent to the server and, if valid,
        the user's email will be marked as valid and the verifyEmailSuccess
        screen will be rendered. If the code is not accepted for any reason,
        the verifyEmail screen is shown and the user has another opportunity
        to have the verification email sent to them.

        NOTE: The links generated in the emails sent to users are based on
        Capture settings found in Janrain's Capture Dashboard. In addition to
        entering the URL of your email verification page, you will need to add
        'screenToRender' as a parameter in the URL with a value of 'verifyEmail'
        which is this screen.
